                <h3>Writing Overview</h3>
                <p>Below are some of my writing examples in my English class and other reasons. One is an argument essay
                    using information from the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline and how the school system can be
                    improved by taking something similar to the school system found in the book. The other is a part of
                    a
                    story about not banality telling the reader everything.</p>

                <h3>Argumentative Essay</h3>
                <p>The current school system in America is very lackluster but in a book about a virtual reality easter
                    egg
                    hunt, hidden away there might be a solution to today's school system problem. In the novel Ready
                    Player
                    One by Esnest Cline, the author hints at a school system in the high tech virtual reality called the
                    OASIS. There is reason to believe that this system can lower bullying and the student actually
                    engaged
                    in the lessons being taught. Along with making students less shy and more outgoing.</p>

                    <h3>Part of my short Story</h3>
                    <p> Louie Gray, reluctantly drives to his job location and mumbles to himself
                        “Oh why here, why so far away, I better get a big payout from this.”
                        He continues driving on in the darkness of the night. He is about 2 miles off of his location
                        when
                        suddenly the GPS goes off with a low pitch droning sound. Louie G still drives forward through the
                        light
                        rain. 10 minutes go by and Louie G starts to mutter to himself and look in every direction to
                        find
                        the house when suddenly the van starts to spin out and goes straight into the forest. Louie G
                        steps
                        out of the van, losing balance due to the shaking he is doing, he walks forward away from the
                        van
                        when the GPS yells out
                        “You have reached your location.”
                        “Well this is the place” He chuckled to himself.
                        He stumbles forward onto a gravel path until he sees the mansion in all its glory, Louie's heart
                        sinks into the ground. Rustling of the bushes catches Louie G off guard. He lets out a scream
                        and
                        runs all the way to the safety of the front door's light. He pushes it open and sees a trail of
                        water on the carpet.
                        “This must be the way to go, I hope” He gulps and treads on through the hallway carefully.
                        While he walks, the damp carpet soaks into Louie's shoes with a wet squishy sound while he
                        walks.
                        The water leaves a trail when out of nowhere, all the books start flying towards Louie G. Louie
                        runs
                        as quick as he can but his heart is still racing and blood pumping. He then sees a shadow run by
                        very quickly and Louie's mind starts to wander.
