            <h3>Writing Overview</h3>
            <p>Below are some of my writing examples in my English class and other reasons. One is an argument essay
                using information from the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline and how the school system can be
                improved by taking something similar to the school system found in the book. The other is a part of a
                story about not banality telling the reader everything.</p>

        <section class="1box, writingExampleReady">
            <p>The current school system in America is very lackluster but in a book about a virtual reality easter egg
                hunt, hidden away there might be a solution to today's school system problem. In the novel Ready Player
                One by Esnest Cline, the author hints at a school system in the high tech virtual reality called the
                OASIS. There is reason to believe that this system can lower bullying and the student actually engaged
                in the lessons being taught. Along with making students less shy and more outgoing.</p>

            <section class="1box, writingExampleLouie">
                <p> Louie Gray, reluctantly drives to his job location and mumbles to himself
                    “Oh why here, why so far away, I should get a big tip from this.”
                    He continues driving on in the darkness of the night. He is about 2 miles off of his location when
                    suddenly the GPS goes off with a powering down sound. Louie G still drives forward through the light
                    rain. 10 minutes go by and Louie G starts to mutter to himself and look in every direction to find
                    the house when suddenly the van starts to spin out and goes straight into the forest. Louie G steps
                    out of the van, losing balance due to the shaking he is doing, he walks forward away from the van
                    when the GPS yells out
                    “You have reached your location.”
                    “Well this is the place” He chuckled to himself.
                    He stumbles forward onto a gravel path until he sees the mansion in all its glory, Louie's heart
                    sinks into the ground. Rustling of the bushes catches Louie G off guard. He lets out a scream and
                    runs all the way to the safety of the front door's light. He pushes it open and sees a trail of
                    water on the carpet.
                    “This must be the way to go, I hope” He gulps and treads on through the hallway carefully.
                    While he walks, the damp carpet soaks into Louie's shoes with a wet squishy sound while he walks.
                    The water leaves a trail when out of nowhere, all the books start flying towards Louie G. Louie runs
                    as quick as he can but his heart is still racing and blood pumping. He then sees a shadow run by
                    very quickly and Louie's mind starts to wander.
