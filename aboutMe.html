            <p>I plan to go to an in-state college, but if a better college with my field catches my eye, I will
                consider going out of state for that reason. I plan not to move out. My current plan is to get my
                bachelors degree to open more job opportunities for me in the future. I hope to do freelance work for
                clients. While in college, I hope to do freelance work for clients. If freelance work does not pan out,
                I would get a part-time coding job to build off my foundations.</p>
