            <h3>Game Design Overview</h3>
            <p>I am skilled in making games feel nice to play with good balancing and pace throughout. I also am able to
                add fun but tricky challenges/extra paths to make the player feel like they have more control and let
                them crave their own play style. With all of these skills, I can help make a fun but difficult game for
                players of all gaming backgrounds and play styles.</p>

            <p>In addition I can help with level/map design to create levels that are replayable or maps that a player
                can go back to and find secrets and goodies when they replay. Being able to hide secrets in a noticeable
                way is something I can do.</p>
